# MIKE SNAKE IS BEST SNAKE (Snek client)

## What

This is a client for [Snek](https://github.com/Ferocia/snek).  In a [5 minute showdown](https://twitter.com/mtcmorris/status/1127768693805539328) this snek was longest Snek but as a staff member at [Ferocia](https://www.ferocia.com.au) was ineligible for the win.

## Getting started

`bundle && bundle exec ruby runner.rb`.

## Thanks

Huge <3 & :+1: to [@cmaitchison](https://github.com/cmaitchison) - for the [pathfinder](https://github.com/mtcmorris/mike-snek-is-best-snek/blob/master/util/lee_path_finder.rb) - this approach outperformed [Polaris](https://github.com/shawn42/polaris) (A Star) for this specific usecase.  I also shameless copied the "conserve space" strategy from Chris's Dangernoodle.

## Liked it? Want more?

Why not work with the lovely people that made it at Ferocia?  Currently recruiting clever engineers - Melbourne/onsite only at this stage.
